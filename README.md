    <h1>Part 1: Directions on Using WebStorm and GitHub</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Step 1: Create a GitHub Account</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Go to GitHub and sign up for an account.</li>
        <li>Follow the on-screen instructions to complete your account setup</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step 2: Install Git</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Download and install Git from Git's official site. This will allow you to manage repositories locally.</li>
        <li>During installation, select the default options unless you need to customize them</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step 3: Install WebStorm</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Download and install WebStorm from the official JetBrains website: WebStorm.
        </li>
        <li>WebStorm is an IDE that integrates well with Git and GitHub, making it easier to manage repositories.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step 4: Create a GitHub Repository</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>After logging into GitHub, click on the “+” icon in the upper right corner and select “New repository.”</li>
        <li>Name the repository A02, and make sure it's public or private based on your requirements.</li>
        <li>Add a README file (this is where you will write the tutorial).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step 5: Clone the Repository Locally Using WebStorm</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Open WebStorm.</li>
        <li>Select Get from VCS from the welcome screen.</li>
        <li>Paste the repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/yourUCID/A02).</li>
        <li> Choose a local directory to clone the repository into.</li>
        <li>Click Clone.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Step 6: Create and Edit Files in WebStorm</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Inside WebStorm, navigate to the project directory.</li>
        <li>Open the README.md file and begin writing your tutorial.</li>
        <li>Any changes made in WebStorm can be tracked and committed via Git directly within the IDE.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step 7: Commit and Push Changes</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>After editing the README file, go to VCS > Commit or use the Commit button at the top.
        </li>
        <li>Write a clear commit message, such as:
            Task: Create README file
            Feature: Added tutorial steps</li>
        <li>Click Commit.</li>
        <li>Push the changes by selecting VCS > Git > Push.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Step 8: Submit Your Repository Link</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>After you have pushed all the necessary changes, copy your repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/yourUCID/A02).</li>
        <li>Submit this link via Canvas to complete the assignment</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Part 2: Glossary of Git Terms</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Branch: A branch in Git is a pointer to a specific set of commits. It allows you to work on different versions of a project simultaneously.</li>
        <li>Clone: The process of copying a repository from GitHub to your local machine.</li>
        <li>Commit: A commit represents a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time.</li>
        <li>Fetch: Fetching is the process of getting updates from a remote repository without merging them into your local codebase.</li>
        <li>GIT: Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously.</li>
        <li>GitHub: A cloud-based hosting service for managing Git repositories.</li>
        <li>Merge: Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another.</li>
        <li>Merge Conflict: Occurs when two branches have conflicting changes that Git cannot automatically merge.</li>
        <li>Push: Pushing sends your local changes (commits) to a remote repository like GitHub</li>
        <li>Pull: Pulling fetches the latest changes from a remote repository and merges them into your local repository.</li>
        <li>Remote: A remote is a version of a project that is hosted on a server, typically on GitHub or another hosting service.</li>
        <li>Repository: A repository is a directory or storage space where your project files and version history are stored.</li>
